This directory includes a mix of utility scripts, example ansible playbooks, and a complete set of configuration files for using vagrant to provision VMs and then use the tooling of this repo to deploy volttron onto those VMs.
The scripts and components here are meant as a starting point and/or example to demonstrate how the system can be used; they have not been developed, tested, or evaluated to a standard that would make them suitable for all uses.
Community members are encouraged to understand and modify them to meet their specific needs, and/or reach out to the core development team for assistance if needed.
