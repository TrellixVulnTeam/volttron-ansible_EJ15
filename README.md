## Installing

You can install this collection directly from the [source repository](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/collections_using.html#installing-a-collection-from-a-git-repository).
That would typically look like:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/volttron/volttron-ansible.git
```
